# Genetic painting 
## Project Description 
This is a 1 month large scale project on applied AI course. We may used any type of algorithm technique to generate a specific art style. 
My project purpose is to use genetic algorithm model to place simple geometric shape on image. After number of iterations, the image should get closer to an Eiffel Tower. 

## Actual work description 
- conduct research on previous work
- writing a project proposal 
- writing, fine-tuning, modifying the actual genetic algorithm code specialized on art generation 
- documented the process of project, evaluation on results 
- conduct a presentation in front of 30-35 people 

## Files description  
- project documentation.pdf : final documentation of this project. 
- genetic_painting.py :  final code 
- FirstIteration.ipynb : code that initially wrote out 
- project proposal.pdf : describes detailed problem description, proposed methods, timeline, risk disclosure. 
- presentation.pptx : presentation slide discussing the my overall project, methods used, process, etc on going genearate art
